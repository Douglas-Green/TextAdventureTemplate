# Interactive JavaScript Game

## Introduction
Welcome to my JavaScript-based interactive game! This project is an ongoing learning journey, crafted with the hope that it serves as both an educational tool and a source of entertainment. It is not a complete game by any stretch of the imagination, as I am still in the process of learning and refining my coding skills.

## About This Game
This game leverages basic JavaScript concepts and provides a framework for a simple yet engaging interactive experience. Players can make choices that influence the game's progression, leading to different outcomes. The core mechanics are implemented in the `game.js` file, which defines game states, options, and transitions.

## Features
- Multiple game states with unique scenarios
- Dynamic user interfaces that respond to player choices
- Customizable text and fear level indicators based on game state
- Interactive buttons with bounce animations

## Goal
My primary aim with this project is to encourage learning through hands-on experience. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand how JavaScript works, or an experienced developer interested in contributing to educational tools, this project is open for collaboration.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork and clone this repository. Any contributions to improve the game, add new features, or refine the code are highly appreciated. This is a great opportunity to practice coding, learn from each other, and expand on a basic project.

## How to Run the Game
To run the game locally:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the folder containing the game files.
3. Run a local server or open the `index.html` file in your browser to start playing.

## Learn and Have Fun!
I hope this project not only helps you understand the fundamentals of JavaScript but also provides a fun and engaging way to test and enhance your coding skills. Enjoy the game, explore the code, and perhaps add your own twist to it!
